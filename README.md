# A* Defense

A strategic tower defense game where you build, upgrade, and position turrets to defend against waves of increasingly difficult enemies.

## Game Overview

In A* Defense, you must strategically place and upgrade turrets to defend against waves of enemies that follow optimal paths (using the A* pathfinding algorithm) to attack your defenses. Each round brings stronger enemies and new challenges, requiring thoughtful strategy and resource management.

## Features

### Turrets
- **Base Turret**: Your starting defensive unit with balanced stats
- **Upgrade Paths**: Each turret can be upgraded along different specialization paths:
  - **Frost**: Slows enemies, making them easier targets
  - **Poison**: Deals damage over time to enemies
  - **Splash**: Damages multiple enemies in an area
  - **Rapid Fire**: Increases attack speed for faster target elimination
  - **Sniper**: Deals high damage at increased range

### Enemies
- **BlueStar (Basic)**: Balanced enemy with moderate stats
- **SpeedEnemy**: Fast but fragile, can quickly reach your turrets
- **TankEnemy**: Slow but tough with high damage output
- **SoldierEnemy**: Well-balanced enemy with moderate stats
- **TitanEnemy**: Mini-boss with high health, damage resistance, and significant rewards

### Game Mechanics
- **Currency System**: Earn currency by defeating enemies to purchase and upgrade turrets
- **Wave-Based Progression**: Face increasingly difficult waves of enemies
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Enemies become stronger as rounds progress
- **Strategic Placement**: Position turrets to create optimal defensive formations

### Coming Soon: Traps
- **Bomb Traps**: Place explosive devices that detonate when enemies are nearby, dealing area damage
- **Spring Traps**: Launch enemies backward along their path, buying you valuable time
- **More trap types to be added in future updates!**

## Strategy Tips

### Turret Placement
- Place turrets at choke points to maximize their effectiveness
- Create a balanced defense with different turret types
- Consider the range and attack patterns of each turret

### Enemy Management
- Prioritize high-threat enemies like Titans and Tanks
- Use Frost turrets against fast enemies
- Deploy area damage against groups of weaker enemies

### Resource Management
- Save currency for key upgrades rather than placing many weak turrets
- Invest in early defenses to earn more currency from defeated enemies
- Balance between upgrading existing turrets and building new ones

### Upcoming Trap Usage
- Place bombs at choke points where enemies cluster
- Use spring traps to reset fast enemies back along their path
- Combine traps with turrets for maximum effectiveness
